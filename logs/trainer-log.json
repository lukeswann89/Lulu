    "gptText": "Virginia awoke from her disorienting dream, the night wrapped softly, comforted her like an interrupted embrace. Life kept her in a bundle, and she fell into the hush of another world. Instinctively, she anchored herself, doubted her own sanity, because who was she to dance? All to see, all real.\n\n\"Truly,\" she said to herself, \"it was a dream of my own, or a wild labyrinthine trick of the mind.\" But between flickers, the whispers she was not yet near to falling asleep, it returned with a sigh—and red lips didn’t wake her up.\n\nEventually, she resigned to the possibility that she was, her way out. But no, she looked back into Virginia's eyes, and time.",
