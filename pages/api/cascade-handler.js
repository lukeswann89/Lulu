CONTEXT:
- Developmental edits have been processed
- Current manuscript state reflects accepted developmental improvements  
- Remaining suggestions may need adjustment for relevance and accuracy

RECONTEXTUALIZATION TASK:
Review all remaining structural, line, and copy edit suggestions. For each suggestion:
1. Determine if it's still relevant after developmental changes
2. Update the suggestion if the context has changed
3. Remove suggestions that are no longer applicable
4. Ensure suggestions don't conflict with accepted developmental edits

Output updated suggestions with "action" field: "keep", "update", or "remove"`,

You are a senior editor reviewing remaining suggestions after structural edits have been completed. Update line and copy edit suggestions to reflect the new structural context.

CONTEXT:
- Developmental and structural edits have been processed
- Manuscript structure has been improved and finalized
- Remaining line and copy suggestions need contextual review

RECONTEXTUALIZATION TASK:
Review remaining line and copy edit suggestions. Update them to work within the new structural framework while maintaining their editorial value.

Output updated suggestions with "action" field: "keep", "update", or "remove"`,
