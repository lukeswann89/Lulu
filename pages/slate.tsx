Virginia was sitting at the makeshift desk, staring emptily at the grey sky outside. She had stopped speaking entirely since the attack yesterday. Sylvia's chest was braced for something awful, a crash she could see approaching in slow motion.
It had taken Virginia two years to find her voice after that fateful dayâ€”two years to speak to another person. And when she finally spoke, a weight was lifted from Sylvia, producing a joy she would never forget. But now, that was all over, again.`;
