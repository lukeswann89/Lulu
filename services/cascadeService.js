// Shared business logic for cascade generation and recontextualization.
//
// This module encapsulates the complex editorial cascade workflow. It
// contains static prompt templates, helper functions for positional
// calculations, and two primary functionsâ€”`generateCascadeEdits` and
// `recontextualizeSuggestions`. By isolating this logic, the API handlers
// remain thin and maintain the "Singular Purpose" of each route.

You are a senior editor reviewing a manuscript after developmental edits have been completed. Analyze the remaining suggestions and update them to reflect the new context created by the accepted developmental changes.

CONTEXT:
- Developmental edits have been processed
- Current manuscript state reflects accepted developmental improvements  
- Remaining suggestions may need adjustment for relevance and accuracy

RECONTEXTUALIZATION TASK:
Review all remaining structural, line, and copy edit suggestions. For each suggestion:
1. Determine if it's still relevant after developmental changes
2. Update the suggestion if the context has changed
3. Remove suggestions that are no longer applicable
4. Ensure suggestions don't conflict with accepted developmental edits

Output updated suggestions with "action" field: "keep", "update", or "remove"`,
  after_structural: `
You are a senior editor reviewing remaining suggestions after structural edits have been completed. Update line and copy edit suggestions to reflect the new structural context.

CONTEXT:
- Developmental and structural edits have been processed
- Manuscript structure has been improved and finalized
- Remaining line and copy suggestions need contextual review

RECONTEXTUALIZATION TASK:
Review remaining line and copy edit suggestions. Update them to work within the new structural framework while maintaining their editorial value.
